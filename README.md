DOCUMENTATION!!!

REACTNATIVE CLI INSTALLATION
I installed a bare reactnative cli project without using ecpo. every information
i needed was found in the reactnative site's official documentation.

FIREBASE APP SETUP
i needed firebase to handle my authentication process so i created a firebase project
with my already existing firebase account and implemented all the config to connect my
local project to my firebase project

REDUX INSTALLATION
i installed redux to help with state management in my application. state manage was implemented 
to help me manage users current status(logged in or logged out)

REACTNATIVE NAVIGATION
i used the reactnative stack navigation to navigate between screens in this application...as the case
may depend i implememnted logic that was supposed to move me between screen.
SITUATIONS OR LOGIC FOR NAVIGATING BETWEEN SCREENS
- user wants to register or sign in
- user wants to be navigated to the home screens after a successful login or registeration
- user wants to logout of the application
- user wants to vist a details page

FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION
I enabled authentication on my firebase project to anable me implement the functionalities on my app.
I used the createemailandpassword and google authentication to verify and register my users. I had to
download a seperate package for the google implentation and also configure some settings in my android
folder to enabl;e google authentication.

RAPIDNEWS API CONSUMPTION
I used the built in javascript async and fetch apis to consume data from the rapid api news endpoint which
was fairly easy and straight forward. the homscreen contains the image and title of a particular news object
and the application is capable of moving you to the details screen after clicking on the particular story youre interested in

SCREENS
- WELCOME SCREEN
- REGISTER SCREEN
- LOGIN SCREEN
- HOME SCREEN 
- DETAIL SCREEN
